## Overview
Spring Boot is an open-source framework built on top of the Spring Framework. It simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a convention-over-configuration approach and embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. 

## Features
- **Auto Configuration**: Reduces the need for explicit configuration files.
- **Standalone Applications**: Allows applications to run independently with embedded servers.
- **Production Ready**: Includes features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configurations.
- **Microservices Support**: Ideal for developing cloud-native applications.
- **Spring Boot Starter Packs**: Predefined dependencies for faster development.

## Getting Started
To create a Spring Boot application, you need to include the required dependencies in your `pom.xml` (for Maven):

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Running a Spring Boot Application
Use the following command to run your application:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

or if using Gradle:

```sh
gradle bootRun
```

## Creating a Simple REST API
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Spring Boot is widely used in enterprise applications due to its simplicity and powerful features. It is the backbone of modern microservices architectures and cloud-based solutions.
